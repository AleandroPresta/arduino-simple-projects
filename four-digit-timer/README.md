# Countdown Timer with Adafruit 7-Segment LED Display and Arduino

This project implements a simple countdown timer using an Adafruit 7-segment LED display and an Arduino board. The timer starts at a specified value and decrements every second until it reaches zero. When the timer hits zero, it triggers a buzzer sound twice and stops the countdown. The code utilizes a boolean variable to control the execution of the countdown loop.

## Components Used
- Adafruit 7-segment LED display
- Arduino board
- Buzzer

## How It Works
- The code initializes the LED display and sets the starting value of the timer.
- In the main loop, the timer value is continuously decremented and displayed on the LED display.
- When the timer reaches zero, the buzzer is triggered twice, and the countdown stops.

## Usage
1. Set up the Arduino board and connect the Adafruit 7-segment LED display.
2. Upload the provided code to the Arduino.
3. Run the code, and the countdown timer will start.
