# 4-Digit LED Display Example

This C++ code demonstrates how to interface with a 4-digit 7-segment LED display using the Adafruit_LEDBackpack library.

## Components
- **Adafruit_LEDBackpack Library**: This library provides functions to control LED backpacks like the one used in this example.
- **4-Digit 7-Segment LED Display**: The display is initialized and controlled to show numerical values.

## Functionality
1. **Setup Function (`setup()`)**:
   - Initializes the LED display.

2. **Loop Function (`loop()`)**:
   - Prints the value stored in `writeValue` to the LED display.
   - Writes the display to show the printed value.
   - Delays for 100 milliseconds.
